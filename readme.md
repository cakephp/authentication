[PSR7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Middleware authentication stack for the CakePHP framework.

Don't know what a middleware is? [Check the CakePHP documentation](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/middleware.html) and additionally [read this.](https://philsturgeon.uk/php/2016/05/31/why-care-about-php-middleware/)

This plugin is for CakePHP 3.4+.
If your application existed before (<= CakePHP 3.3), please make sure it is adjusted to leverage middleware as described in the [docs](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/middleware.html#adding-the-new-http-stack-to-an-existing-application).

## What is it?
This package is an Authentication middleware layer for authenticating requests coming into your application, using various authenticators and indentifiers.

## What it is not
The package only provides authentication and not authorization. It can be used to find out who someone is, but not what they're allowed to do. 

## Quick Start

Add the authentication service to the middleware. See the CakePHP [documentation](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/middleware.html#) on how to use a middleware if you don't know what it is or how to work with it.

### Configuration

Example of configuring the authentication middleware.

```php
use Authentication\AuthenticationService;
use Authentication\Middleware\AuthenticationMiddleware;

class Application extends BaseApplication
{
    public function middleware($middlewareStack)
    {
        // Various other middlewares for error handling, routing etc. added here.

        // Instantiate the service
        $service = new AuthenticationService();

        // Load identifiers
        $service->loadIdentifier('Authentication.Orm', [
            'fields' => [
                'username' => 'email',
                'password' => 'password'
            ]
        ]);

        // Load the authenticators, you want session first
        $service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.Session', [
            'sessionKey' => 'Auth'
        ]);
        $service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.Form', [
            'fields' => [
                'username' => 'email',
                'password' => 'password'
            ]
        ]);

        // Add it to the authentication middleware
        $authentication = new AuthenticationMiddleware($service);

        // Add the middleware to the middleware stack
        $middlewareStack->add($authentication);

        return $middlewareStack;
    }
}
```

If one of the configured authenticators was able to validate the credentials,
the middleware will add the authentication service to the request object as an
attribute. If you're not yet familiar with request attributes [check the PSR7
documentation](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

### Using Stateless Authenticators with other Authenticators

When using `HttpBasic` or `HttpDigest` with other authenticators, you should
remember that these authenticators will halt the request when authentication
credentials are missing or invalid. This is necessary as these authenticators
must send specific challenge headers in the response. If you want to combine
`HttpBasic` or `HttpDigest` with other authenticators, you may want to configure
these authenticators as the *last* authenticators:

```php
use Authentication\AuthenticationService;

// Instantiate the service
$service = new AuthenticationService();

// Load identifiers
$service->loadIdentifier('Authentication.Orm', [
    'fields' => [
        'username' => 'email',
        'password' => 'password'
    ]
]);

// Load the authenticators leaving Basic as the last one.
$service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.Session', [
    'sessionKey' => 'Auth'
]);
$service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.Form', [
    'fields' => [
        'username' => 'email',
        'password' => 'password'
    ]
]);
$service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.HttpBasic');
```

### Accessing the user / identity data

You can get the authenticated identity data from the request by doing this:

```php
$user = $request->getAttribute('identity');
```

### Checking the login status

You can check if the authentication process was successful by accessing the result object of the authentication process that comes as well as a request attribute:

```php
$result = $request->getAttribute('authentication')->getResult();
if ($result->isValid()) {
    $user = $request->getAttribute('identity');
} else {
    $this->log($result->getCode());
    $this->log($result->getErrors());
}
```

### Clearing the identity / logging the user out

To log an identity out just call the services clearIdentity() method:

```php
$result = $request->getAttribute('authentication')->clearIdentity($request, $response);
debug($result);
```

The debug will show you an array like this:

```
[
    'response' => object(Cake\Http\Response) { ... },
    'request' => object(Cake\Http\ServerRequest) { ... }
]
```

**Attention!** This will return an array containing the request and response objects. Since both are immutable you'll get new objects back. Depending on your context you're working in you'll have to use these instances from now on if you want to continue to work with the modified response and request objects.

## Migration from the AuthComponent

### Differences

* No authentication layer is provided, you will need to build this yourself.
* There is no automatic checking of the session. To get the actual user data from the session you'll have to use the `SessionAuthenticator`. It will check the session if there is data in the configured session key and put it into the identity object.
* The user data is no longer available through the AuthComponent but is accessible via a request attribute and encapsulated in an identity object: `$request->getAttribute('authentication')->getIdentity();`
* The logic of the authentication process has been split into authenticators and identifiers. An authenticator will extract the credentials from the request, while identifiers verify the credentials and find the matching user.
* DigestAuthenticate has been renamed to HttpDigestAuthenticator
* BasicAuthenticate has been renamed to HttpBasicAuthenticator

### Similarities

* All the existing authentication adapters, Form, Basic, Digest are still there but have been refactored into authenticators.

### Identifiers and authenticators

Following the principle of separation of concerns, the former authentication objects were split into separate objects, identifiers and authenticators.

* **Authenticators** take the incoming request and try to extract identification credentials from it. If credentials are found, they are passed to a collection of identifiers where the user is located. For that reason authenticators take an IdentifierCollection as first constructor argument.
* **Identifiers** are verify identification credentials against a storage system. eg. (ORM tables, LDAP etc) and return identified user data.

This makes it easy to change the identification logic as needed or use several sources of user data.

If you want to implement your own identifiers, your identifier must implement the `IdentifierInterface`.

### Migrating your authentication setup

Remove authentication from the AuthComponent and put the middleware in place like shown above. Then configure your authenticators the same way as you did for the AuthComponent before.

Change your code to use the identity data from the `identity` request attribute instead of using `$this->Auth->user();`. The returned value is null if no identity was found or the identification of the provided credentials failed.

```php
$user = $request->getAttribute('identity');
```

For more details about the result of the authentication process you can access the result object that also comes with the request and is accessible on the `authentication` attribute.

```php
$authResult = $request->getAttribute('authentication')->getResult();
// Bool if the result is valid
debug($authResult->isValid());
// A status code
debug($authResult->getCode());
// An array of error messages or data if the identifier provided any
debug($authResult->getError());
```

The huge config array from the AuthComponent needs to be split into identifiers and authenticators when configuring the service. So when you had your AuthComponent configured this way

```php
$this->loadComponent('Auth', [
    'authentication' => [
        'Form' => [
            'fields' => [
                'username' => 'email',
                'password' => 'password'
            ]
        ]
    ]
]);
```

you'll now have to configure it this way.

```php
// Instantiate the service
$service = new AuthenticationService();

// Load identifiers
$service->loadIdentifier('Authentication.Orm', [
    'fields' => [
        'username' => 'email',
        'password' => 'password'
    ]
]);

// Load the authenticators
$service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.Session', [
    'sessionKey' => 'Auth'
]);
$service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.Form', [
    'fields' => [
        'username' => 'email',
        'password' => 'password'
    ]
]);
```

While this seems to be a little more to write, the benefit is a greater flexibility and better [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Plus, with this separation, it gives you much greater flexibility in developing your own authorization layer.

## Authenticators

### Token

The token authenticator can authenticate a request based on a token that comes along with the request in the headers or in the request parameters.

Configuration options:

* **queryParam**: Name of the query parameter. Configure it if you want to get the token from the query parameters.
* **header**: Name of the header. Configure it if you want to get the token from the header.

### JWT

The JWT authenticator gets the [JWT token](https://jwt.io/) from the header or query param and either returns the payload directly or passes it to the identifiers to verify them against another datasource for example.

* **header**: The header line to check for the token. The default is `Authorization`.
* **queryParam**: The query param to check for the token. The default is `token`.
* **tokenPrefix**: The token prefix. Default is `bearer`.
* **algorithms**: An array of hashing algorithms for Firebase JWT. Default is an array `['HS256']`.
* **entityClass**: The entity class to use for the payload data. Default is `Cake\ORM\Entity`
* **returnPayload**: To return or not return the token payload directly without going through the identifiers. Default is `true`.
* **secretKey**: Default is `null` but you're **required** to pass a secret key if you're not in the context of a CakePHP application that provides it through `Security::salt()`.

If you want to identify the user based on the `sub` (subject) of the token you can use the JwtSubject identifier.

```php
$service = new AuthenticationService();
$service->loadIdentifier('Authentication.JwtSubject');
$service->loadAuthenticator('Authentication.Jwt', [
    'returnPayload' => false
]);
```

### Session

This authenticator will check the session if it contains user data or credentials

Configuration options:

* **sessionKey**: The session key for the user data, default is `Auth`

### Form

Looks up the data in the request body, usually when a form submit happens via POST / PUT.

Configuration options:

* **loginUrl**: The login URL, string or array. Default is `null` and all pages will be checked.
* **fields**: Array that maps `username` and `password` to the specified fields.
* **passwordHasher**: Password hasher class, defaults to `DefaultPasswordHasher::class`

**Warning**: If you use the array syntax for the URL, the URL will be generated by the CakePHP router. The result *might* differ from what you actually have in the request URI depending on your route handling. So consider this to be case sensitive!

### HttpBasic

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

Configuration options:

* **realm**: Default is `$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']` override it as needed.

### HttpDigest

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication

Configuration options:

* **realm**: Default is `null`
* **qop**: Default is `auth`
* **nonce**: Default is `uniqid(''),`
* **opaque**: Default is `null`

## Events

There is only one event that is fired by authentication: `Authentication.afterIdentify`.

If you don't know what events are and how to use them [check the documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/core-libraries/events.html).

The `Authentication.afterIdentify` event is fired by the `AuthenticationComponent` after an identity was successfully identified.

The event contains the following data:

 * **provider**: An object that implements `\Authentication\Authenticator\AuthenticateInterface`
 * **identity**: An object that implements `\Cake\Datasource\EntityInterface`
 * **service**:  An object that implements `\Authentication\AuthenticationServiceInterface`

The subject of the event will be the current controller instance the AuthenticationComponent is attached to.

But the event is only fired if the authenticator that was used to identify the identity is *not* persistent and *not* stateless. The reason for this is that the event would be fired every time because the session authenticator or token for example would trigger it every time for every request. 
 
From the included authenticators only the FormAuthenticator will cause the event to be fired. After that the session authenticator will provide the identity.
