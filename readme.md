[PSR7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Middleware authentication stack for the CakePHP framework.

Don't know what middleware is? [Check the CakePHP documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/controllers/middleware.html) and additionally [read this.](https://philsturgeon.uk/php/2016/05/31/why-care-about-php-middleware/)

## Authentication, not Authorization

This plugin intends to provide a framework around authentication and user
identification. Authorization is a [separate
concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) that has been
packaged into a separate [authorization plugin](https://github.com/cakephp/authorization).
